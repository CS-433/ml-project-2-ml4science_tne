  abstract = {Summary
  Epileptic seizures are manifestations of epilepsy. Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. As EEG signals are non-stationary, the conventional method of frequency analysis is not highly successful in diagnostic classification. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using wavelet transform and classification using artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR). Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. In epileptic seizure classification we used lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LBDWT) as a preprocessing method to increase the computational speed. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational load of those algorithms that were based on classical wavelet transform (CWT). In this study, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers) the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on ANN. Logistic regression as well as multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used LBDWT coefficients of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or non-epileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying LBDWT in connection with MLPNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The MLPNN based classifier outperformed the LR based counterpart. Within the same group, the MLPNN based classifier was more accurate than the LR based classifier.}

    abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is a family of machine learning methods that has gained considerable attention in the scientific community, breaking benchmark records in areas such as speech and visual recognition. DL differs from conventional machine learning methods by virtue of its ability to learn the optimal representation from the raw data through consecutive nonlinear transformations, achieving increasingly higher levels of abstraction and complexity. Given its ability to detect abstract and complex patterns, DL has been applied in neuroimaging studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders, which are characterised by subtle and diffuse alterations. Here we introduce the underlying concepts of DL and review studies that have used this approach to classify brain-based disorders. The results of these studies indicate that DL could be a powerful tool in the current search for biomarkers of psychiatric and neurologic disease. We conclude our review by discussing the main promises and challenges of using DL to elucidate brain-based disorders, as well as possible directions for future research.}

Here, in 69 participants we compared implicit and explicit methods of political attitude assessment and focused our investigation on populist attitudes. Ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from future voters while they completed a survey that measured levels of agreement on different political issues. An Implicit Association Test (IAT) was administered at the end of the recording session. Neural signals differed as a function of future vote for a populist or mainstream party and of whether survey items expressed populist or non-populist views. The combination of EEG responses and self-reported preferences predicted electoral choice better than traditional socio-demographic and ideological variables, while IAT scores were not a significant predictor. These findings suggest that measurements of brain activity can refine the assessment of socio-political attitudes, even when those attitudes are not based on traditional ideological divides.},

This research explains these groups’ dissimilar moral stances when they face ethical transgressions in business. Research that explores the effects of ideological asymmetry on moral reasoning processes through moral foundations (i.e., fairness and authority) has been limited. We hypothesize two different moral reasoning processes and test them in the South Korean culture. Study 1 uses the neuroscientific method of event-related potentials (ERP) to explore the dissociable neural mechanisms that underlie Korean liberals’ and conservatives’ moral reasoning processes in business ethical transgressions. Liberals’ early frontal negative-going (EFN) brain waves showed that they are quick to pass negative judgment by intuitively detecting violations of fairness (i.e., moral engagement), while conservatives’ temporoparietal positive-going (TPP) brain waves showed that they have a higher motivation to respect authority (i.e., moral rationalization). Both liberals’ and conservatives’ ERP components occur within the first second of the decision-making phase, suggesting the rapid and intuitive nature of moral reasoning processes. Study 2 tests a mediating process and confirms that Korean liberals (conservatives) exhibit the moral engagement (rationalization) strategy, through the fairness (authority) foundation. These findings from our interdisciplinary research deepen the knowledge of the complexity of human morality in business ethics research.},

    ABSTRACT = {Data privacy is a major concern when accessing and processing sensitive medical data. A promising approach among privacy-preserving techniques is homomorphic encryption (HE), which allows for computations to be performed on encrypted data. Currently, HE still faces practical limitations related to high computational complexity, noise accumulation, and sole applicability the at bit or small integer values level. We propose herein an encoding method that enables typical HE schemes to operate on real-valued numbers of arbitrary precision and size. The approach is evaluated on two real-world scenarios relying on EEG signals: seizure detection and prediction of predisposition to alcoholism. A supervised machine learning-based approach is formulated, and training is performed using a direct (non-iterative) fitting method that requires a fixed and deterministic number of steps. Experiments on synthetic data of varying size and complexity are performed to determine the impact on runtime and error accumulation. The computational time for training the models increases but remains manageable, while the inference time remains in the order of milliseconds. The prediction performance of the models operating on encoded and encrypted data is comparable to that of standard models operating on plaintext data.},
