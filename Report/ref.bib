  abstract = {Data from power analysis of the human EEG were processed statistically, and an area within the power spectrum was identified, limited by the abscissa and by an exponential curve, the parameters of which could be defined by a moving linear regression after logarithmic transform of the spectral data. The EEG signal of normal subjects and epileptics with borderline EEG tracings was studied before and after administration of neuroactive compounds. The exponential curve was found to be negative in all subjects; its parameters were symmetrical and were not modified by the drugs administered, though these were active on the spectral profile. The area limited by the curve was used as a reference for the standardization of the power values with respect to a constant to the signal. The method allowed a better definition of the spectral profile than it is obtained by normalization vs. the total power value.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Despite rapid advances in machine learning tools, the majority of neural decoding approaches still use traditional methods. Modern machine learning tools, which are versatile and easy to use, have the potential to significantly improve decoding performance. This tutorial describes how to effectively apply these algorithms for typical decoding problems. We provide descriptions, best practices, and code for applying common machine learning methods, including neural networks and gradient boosting. We also provide detailed comparisons of the performance of various methods at the task of decoding spiking activity in motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus. Modern methods, particularly neural networks and ensembles, significantly outperform traditional approaches, such as Wiener and Kalman filters. Improving the performance of neural decoding algorithms allows neuroscientists to better understand the information contained in a neural population and can help to advance engineering applications such as brain--machine interfaces. Our code package is available at               github.com/kordinglab/neural\_decoding               .},

  abstract = {The paper is devoted to the study of EEG-based people verification. Analyzed solutions employed shallow artificial neural networks using spectral EEG features as input representation. We investigated the impact of the features derived from different frequency bands and their combination on verification results. Moreover, we studied the influence of a number of hidden neurons in a neural network. The datasets used in the analysis consisted of signals recorded during resting state from 29 healthy adult participants performed on different days, 20 EEG sessions for each of the participants. We presented two different scenarios of training and testing processes. In the first scenario, we used different parts of each recording session to create the training and testing datasets, and in the second one, training and testing datasets originated from different recording sessions. Among single frequency bands, the best outcomes were obtained for the beta frequency band (mean accuracy of 91 and 89\% for the first and second scenarios, respectively). Adding the spectral features from more frequency bands to the beta band features improved results (95.7 and 93.1\%). The findings showed that there is not enough evidence that the results are different between networks using different numbers of hidden neurons. Additionally, we included results for the attack of 23 external impostors whose recordings were not used earlier in training or testing the neural network in both scenarios. Another significant finding of our study shows worse sensitivity results in the second scenario. This outcome indicates that most of the studies presenting verification or identification results based on the first scenario (dominating in the current literature) are overestimated when it comes to practical applications.},
